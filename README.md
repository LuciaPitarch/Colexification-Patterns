# Colexification-Patterns
Code repository for my MA thesis about the hidden linguistic patterns that shape semantic change in colexifications. 

Â¿Why did we have two words in Latin for FEEL (sentire) and LISTEN (audire) but just one in Catalan (sentire)?

# Project structure
For this project we scripted 4 codes:
1. The first one selects the studied languages in our thesis, from all the data available in CLICS3
2. The second one creates the colexifications by looking for concepts that share the same wordform in the same language
3. The third one runs the feature extraction. Extracts the linguistic features that might predict loss or mainteanance of colexifications from the oldest languages (i.e. Latin) to the synchronous ones (i.e. Spanish)
4. The fourth one is used for the data analysis and visualization

# Acknowledgements
The code was scripted in Google collab environment and uses both R and Python languages. 

The raw data was retrieved from CLICS3, an open-source database for colexification studies from Rzymski et al., 2019.

I could not have done this project without the help of my thesis supervisor @brochhagen and the feedback and support of @Sarabert96.
